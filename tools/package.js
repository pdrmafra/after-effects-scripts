const readme=`After Effects Scripts v${version} — Pedro Mafra
https://github.com/pdrmafra/after-effects-scripts

INSTALL
1. In After Effects choose File > Scripts > Run Script File... and pick a script from the "Scripts" folder.
   Each file there works on its own; nothing else to install.
2. To keep them in the File > Scripts menu, copy them into After Effects' Scripts folder and restart AE:
   macOS:   /Applications/Adobe After Effects <version>/Scripts
   Windows: C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe After Effects <version>\\Support Files\\Scripts
3. Font Inspector's Save Report and Depth Map need "Allow Scripts to Write Files and Access Network"
   (Settings or Preferences > Scripting & Expressions).

BEFORE YOU USE THEM
- Save your project first. Each script's changes undo with a single Cmd/Ctrl+Z.
- Tested on After Effects 26.5 on macOS. Windows and older versions have not been tested yet.
- Shape to Stroke is experimental. Depth Map is advanced (macOS, needs a Python setup).

WHAT'S INSIDE
Scripts/                     Transform to Null, Spacing Keyframes, Stepped Keyframes, Font Inspector, Shape to Stroke
Shape to Stroke test comps/  Run Create-Test-Fixtures.jsx to add READY, SKIP and ICONS test comps. Keep these files together.
depth-map/                   Keep the whole folder; follow depth-map/README.md before running jsx/DepthMapStatic.jsx.
